# A more correct `unix`

KriomOS is slated to be the first [sajban](https://github.com/sajban/aski) project. It aims
to provide a *correct* runtime for [kriOS](https://github.com/sajban/kriOS) using linux. It
can be thought of as an evolved version of NixOS, which is used for the
bootstrap version.
